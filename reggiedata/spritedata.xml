    <checkbox nybble="10" title="Invisible Collision Box" comment="While strange, this value's function is clear: When the game loads the platform for the first time into view, and the player then leaves the screen, this value tells the game to remember the last position of the platform. It will then spawn an equally large collision box exactly over its last position. Mario cannot fall through this collision box, but he may pass through coming from below. I.e. when loading the platforms back to the original position, Mario is carried by the collision box, if he stands on it. This happens each time the platform leaves the screen. The bad thing is that Mario cannot activate more platforms when he stands exactly over their original position, where they spawned initially." />

At this position, an upward-moving platform will stop ; however, a downward-moving platform will move continuously if a value of '1' is used and the platform is positioned below the 'Travel Limit' line. If the platform is placed above the 'Travel Limit' line, it will automatically be moved to the 'Travel Limit' line (no matter which direction it is moving) when it becomes active. The 'Travel Limit' line is located 7.5 Blocks below the upper zone border. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This platform functions independently of scroll limits (therefore, the 'Travel Limit' ignores scroll limits).">

Setting a value of 0 results in an automatic use of value 5. Furthermore, the value is automatically multiplied by 64. At 0 and 5, we get a value of 320. Treeki also thinks that this option could represent a counter. What this option actually does is control the blinking of the carrier platform. If the multiplied value is below 180 AND if the second bit of the nybble was used, the carrier platform will not be rendered. Otherwise, this option only has the ability to tweak the blinking of the carrier platform. One would have to play around with some values​​." />

Well fine, I'll share the limited documentation we have on why you shouldn't use these settings: Falling Water works in a peculiar way. When the appropriate event has not been activated, or there is no corresponding event, [Never ON] then the water surface will appear [Distance] blocks higher. The water will then sink this many blocks, respecting any delays. After waiting for the delay at the bottom, the water surface will not rise again. Not exactly. Instead, it will 'skip' the rising part and 'jump' to immediately to the top. Additionally, using this with events will cause the water to rise, instead of falling. [ON] But the starting point is the same higher distance. The difference is that the water rises continuously as long as the event is enabled. [Endless Rising] If it is disabled, [OFF after ON] the water surface will 'jump' back to where it started and remain there until the event is re-enabled. [Why bother?] Additionally, 1-5 on Movement Speed values have some additional odd glitchiness. Supposedly. So please, stop trying to combine settings like this. Or your level will suck."

   <sprite id="139" name="Lava" notes="Same settings as water. It can definitely be tricked by events to bring the lava surface back to the starting point (except probably mode 9+).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It's also possible to get rising / falling lava involving locations. If Mario or an enemy is touching a location, the lava will fall. It will then rise back up again when Mario/enemy leaves the location.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Furthermore, the lava can also automatically rise the specified number of blocks up and down with self-defined delay periods, regardless of locations. This works by switching the Event ID on and off in the right intervals. If the given Event ID is activated, the lava will rise the given number of blocks. If the Event ID is deactivated, the lava will fall again, but only if it has already reached the end of its Rising / Falling distance. Through an event system with at least 4 event controllers it is therefore possible to build a system that activates and deactivates the given Event ID indefinitely. A correct duration must of course be set for the event controllers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:green;&quot;&gt;Yoshi does not work or interact with this sprite.&lt;/span&gt;">

This can be set with the option 'Distance'. The lava will then sink this many blocks, respecting the delay. After waiting for the delay at the bottom, the lava surface will not rise again, but instead 'skip' the rising part and 'jump' to the top. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Using this with events will cause the lava to rise, instead of falling. But the starting point is the same as with the sinking behavior. The difference is that the lava rises continuously as long as the event is enabled.

During the whole fight, Yoshi cannot move, but Bowser Jr. cannot hit Mario while he sits on Yoshi. With Yoshi in the level, Bowser Jr. can be hit even before he jumps into his clown copter. Damage can be inflicted with a jump / ramming attack, something that would not work without Yoshi in the level. &lt;br&gt;The negative effect of this 'Pre Attack' is that the Boss (Cutscene and Ending Related) Controller for the Bowser Jr. Fight (sprite 409) then turns off and thus continues the fight without this Boss Controller. &lt;br&gt;One side effect of the failure of the Boss Controller is that Bowser Jr. will fly very 'low' with his clown copter. The boss fight can end, but not while sitting on Yoshi. And when you sit on Yoshi while Bowser Jr. falls after his defeat, you can hear the victory music, but nothing else happens. Mario is stuck in the room forever and a reset is needed.&lt;br&gt;

  <sprite id="216" name="Poisoned Water" notes="Same settings as water. It can definitely be tricked by events to bring the poisoned water surface back to the starting point (except probably mode 9+).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It's also possible to get rising / falling poisoned water involving locations. If Mario or an enemy is touching a location, the poisoned water will fall. It will then rise back up again when Mario/enemy leaves the location.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Furthermore, the poisoned water can also automatically rise the specified number of blocks up and down with self-defined delay periods, regardless of locations. This works by switching the Event ID on and off in the right intervals. If the given Event ID is activated, the poisoned will rise the given number of blocks. If the Event ID is deactivated, the poisoned water will fall again, but only if it has already reached the end of its Rising / Falling distance. Through an event system with at least 4 event controllers it is therefore possible to build a system that activates and deactivates the given Event ID indefinitely. A correct duration must of course be set for the event controllers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:green;&quot;&gt;Yoshi does not work or interact with this sprite.&lt;/span&gt;">

The main problem is that this option only works in ONE zone, while affecting all poisoned water sprites in this zone. If a second sprite is used in another zone with a greater Y-value, the lower zone will be completely filled with poisoned water.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;All values marked with an asterisk &lt;b&gt;(*)&lt;/b&gt; work in a particular way: When the appropriate event has not been activated, or there is no corresponding event, then the poisoned water surface will appear higher. This can be set with the option 'Distance'. The poisoned water will then sink this many blocks, respecting the delay. After waiting for the delay at the bottom, the poisoned water surface will not rise again, but instead 'skip' the rising part and 'jump' to the top. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Using this with events will cause the poisoned water to rise, instead of falling. But the starting point is the same as with the sinking behavior. The difference is that the poisoned water rises continuously as long as the event is enabled. If it is disabled, the poisoned water surface will be right back where the poisoned water has started to rise and remain there until the event is re-enabled. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:red;&quot;&gt;Using sprites with and without an asterisk &lt;b&gt;(*)&lt;/b&gt; together (and both have 'Distance' set) in the same zone could cause the game to CRASH!!&lt;/span&gt;">

With Yoshi in the level, Bowser Jr. can be hit, even before he jumped into his 'Clown Copter'. Damage can be inflicted with a jump / ramming attack, something that would not work without Yoshi in the level. The negative effect of this 'Pre Attack' is that the Boss (Cutscene and Ending Related) Controller for the Bowser Jr. Fight (409) then turns off and thus continues the fight without this Boss Controller. Side effects for the failure of the Boss Controller is that Bowser Jr. will fly very 'low' with his Clown Copter... The Boss fight can end, but not while sitting on Yoshi. And when you sit on Yoshi while Bowser Jr. falls after his defeat, you can hear the victory fanfare, but nothing else happens. Mario is caught in the room and a reset is needed.&lt;br&gt;
